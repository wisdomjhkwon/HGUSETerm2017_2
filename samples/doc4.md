Building Markdown Converter
========

Overview
---------------
This assignment askes you to build a program that reads a **Markdown** file and converts it to a HTML file.
You are given a documentation [link][1] on the Markdown syntax which starts as follows:
> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
> as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
> Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters – including Setext, atx,
> Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText – the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s
> syntax is the format of plain text email.

Code Blocks
---------
Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code.
Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally.
Markdown wraps a code block in both \<pre\> and \<code\> tags. For example:

<pre><code> if (x > y)
  return x ;
else
  return y ;
</code></pre>
